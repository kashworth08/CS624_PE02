<h1>Inputs</h1>
<p>The only user input is in the "Enter Your Favorite Course" box. Nothing is done with that input though.</p>

<h1>Process</h1>
<p>The index.tsx file calls out the Courses.tsx file. The Courses file contains all the classes grouped by their category (Core, Depth of Study, Capstone). The Courses file then defines how the screen will display the information as well as calling out the icon.png and allowing the user to input their favorite course. </p>

<h1>Output</h1>
<p>The output is a scrollable page with all the MSCS course requirements. </p>
